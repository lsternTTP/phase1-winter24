    <h2>My Favorite Quick Bread Recipes</h2>
    <main>
      <div>
        <p>My portfolio projects consist of my baking and beaded jewelry projects at this time. I will sometimes give
          pieces away just for fun unless the project is a commission project. I have several others planned that are
          experimental in techniques that I am learning, such as wirework and macrame pieces. One of my favorites below
          is
          the Grinch bracelet for my niece, Jamikka.</p>
        <p>Several macrame pieces will be added later; a few are in experiments using leather as well as wire macrame
          involving beads. This site will be a work in progress for these projects as well as my bread section.</p>
        <p>This is a section of favorite quick breads that I do frequently. I will add more as I successfully make them.
          NOTE: These are from <i>Great American Home Baking</i>.</p>

        <p>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoons salt</p>

        <p>Preheat oven and lightly grease and flour a loaf pan, setting it aside. Combine the dry ingredients (flour,
          ginger, baking powder, salt and sugar) and mix well. Add oil, eggs, lemon or lime peel, lemon or lime juice
          and shredded zucchini. Stir only to combine; don't overmix and batter should be smooth. DO NOT ADD THE
          ZUCCHINI JUICE! </p>
        <p>Pour into prepared pan and bake for 50-60 minutes; knife or skewer should come out clean. (NOTE: No need to

        <img src="images/Lemon Loaf Cake.png" alt="Lemon Loaf Cake with Strawberries"></a>
        <p>This is the perfect solution for using up extra egg yolks. It uses only the egg yolks, has a rich, tender
          crumb. Pair it with ice cream, gelato or fruit.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>(Prep time: 20 minutes at 350 degrees; Bake 50 minutes). Double the ingredients if you use a bundt pan. If
          you use a 9 x 5 x 3 loaf pan: </p>
        <p>6 tbsp butter or margarine </p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar </p>
        <p>4 egg yokes (1/3 cup) </p>
        <p>1-1/4 cups of cake flour> </p>
        <p>1-1/2 tsp of baking powder
        <p>
        <p>Dash of salt</p>
        <p>1/3 cup milk </p>
        <p>1/2 tsp of vanilla </p>
        <p>1/4 tsp of lemon extract </p>
        <p>Grated peel of 1 lemon </p>
        <p>1/2 tsp lemon juice </p>
        <p>Powdered sugar</p>
        <p>Fresh Fruit for Garnish </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>Cream butter and gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl until
          light and lemon colored. Blend into the creamed butter mixture. </p>
        <p>In a separate bowl, sift together dry ingredients (flour, baking powder and salt), alternately adding milk
          and beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla, lemon extract, lemon peel and lemon juice. Again, blend
          ingredients well.</p>
        <p>Pour into a well-greased, floured loaf pan and bake at 350 for 50 minutes. Use a knife or cake tester to test
          if done. Dust top with powdered sugar, fresh fruit. Enjoy!</p>

        <img src="images/Peanut Butter Bread.png" alt="Peanut Butter Bread"></a>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>(Prep time: 30 minutes; Bake @ 350 degrees)</p>
        <p>2 cups - all purpose flour</p>

        <p>1-1/4 teaspoons salt</p>
        <p>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>
        <p>3/4 cup of firmly packed light brown sugar (Domino's or your favorite kind</p>
        <p>3/4 cup of smooth or chunky peanut butter</p>
        <p>1/4 cup of honey</p>
        <p>1/4 cup (half stick) softened butter</p>
        <p>2 large eggs</p>
        <p>1-1/4 cup of whole or low-fat milk</p>
        <p>optional: 1 cup of roasted peanuts</p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Beat the peanut butter and butter at medium speed
          until smooth; add the brown sugar and beat until smooth and light. Add the honey and eggs, 1 at a time; pour
          milk in a thin stream into the mixture.</p>
        <p>Add flour mixture in at low speed until combined. Add in extra peanuts, if desired. Bake at 350 degrees for
          40
          minutes, then reduce oven temp to 325 because this bread burns easily. Cover with foil to prevent overbrowning
          if necessary. Bake for 30 minutes more until done, testing with a knife.</p>
