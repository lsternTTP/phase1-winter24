      <h3> Nice to see you here. </h3>
      <p> Hello! I'm Olena, a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating beautiful and functional
        websites. My journey in web development started 3 months ago, and since then, I've been continuously learning
        and honing my skills to deliver high-quality projects. I specialize in front-end development, and I love turning
        ideas into reality with clean, efficient code and creative design. Here are a couple of projects that showcase
        my skills and dedication.</p>
