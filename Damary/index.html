       <h1 id="welcome-header" class="welcome-header">Welcome to <br> Damary Vila's <br>Project Code Portfolio Page</h1>
       <p>Project Code is a 12-week program offered by the New York Public Library, for free. In as little as 12 weeks students with exposure to Web development or those looking to be exposed for the first time will learn sufficient HTML and CSS to create and design their very own Web pages using FreeCode Camp and Replit. Students are welcome to add their code to their GitHub account, but it is not necessary for students to have a GitHub account or use it.</p>
         <p>The requirements include a total of nine homework assignments, and three projects. The first and third projects have predetermined topics and deadlines. While the second topic also has a specified deadline, students could choose one of three topics. In addition, students can complete optional homework assignments to keep their learning momentum, by practicing their new skills.</p>
         <p>The topic of the first web page is a Tribute to someone or something, and I opted to pay tribute to my mother, a hardworking, resolute, talented, creative woman. To share the page with my family in Puerto Rico I took the liberty of translating the page into Spanish.</p>
        <p> The options for the second project were a Survey form, a technical page, or a Product Landing page. While I aspire to complete all three projects to earn a Certification in Responsive Web Design, the timespan to complete this project was short. Therefore, to fulfill the requirement to meet the deadline I opted to create an Order Survey Form. I offer custom handmade Rosaries with the option to teach others how to pray the Rosary or simply connect people to form prayer groups. The Order Survey form will serve as the first interaction I have with my clients. The data collected will allow me to serve my clientâ€™s needs efficiently.</p>
        <p> Rather than doing the technical page on how I created the Survey page or on the creative process that I follow when making my Rosaries, I opted to write our  recipe for Pasteles. Pasteles is a labor-intensive meet patty dish traditionally made and eaten by Puerto Ricans during the holiday season, from Thanksgiving to the Epiphany, Three Kings Day.</p>
       <p>  As noted above I will be completing the Product Landing page which is currently a dead link on this page.</p>
         <p>The final project is this Project Portfolio page where students are given the opportunity to showcase what they have learned, and how they have applied their creativity to their work. This was an amazing experience, for multiple reasons, and I appreciate everyone at the New York Public Library responsible for this opportunity. I hope that everyone that visits my pages enjoys what I have created, but more so that they leave inspired to continue their own Web development journey or embark on a new journey by learning to code using HTML and CSS. I invite you to sign the guest book below, provide feedback and your contact information. <p>


         Project Code is a free 12 week program offered by the New York Public Library, that allows one anyone who has been exposed Web development or those interested in learning how to build a using ild a Web page using HTML and CSS. During the program students are required to complete nine homework assignments, and the opportunity to complete additional optional assignments using FreeCode Camp. In addition students get the opportunity to showcase the skills they've learneand complete three projects on their own, which allows them to showcase the skills that they have learned.</p>

   <p> Over 12 weeks I've created the following five projects using HTML and CSS. Although I created completed five projects the program itself only requires that we complete three projects. <br>The first project was a tribute page to my mom which I translated into Spanish. The second project was a survey form which collects data from clients before they place their order. The third project is a product landing page which is a product landing page for a fictional company. The fourth project is a technical landing page for a recipe of a popular dish eaten in Puerto Rico during the Christmas sason. The fifth project this personal portfolio website. </p>
